### README.md

Explain:

* What the demo does and why DocMDP + FieldMDP + append mode are required for multi-timepoint signatures.
* How to build: `mvn -q -DskipTests package`
* How to run the 5-step scenario above.
* How to open the PDF in Adobe Reader to inspect each signature’s **revision** and the lock icons on fields.
* Cautions: never “optimize” or “print to PDF” after signing; that breaks earlier signatures.

### Stretch (optional if time allows)
